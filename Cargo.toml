# This will build for the target platform
# The python must match that (i.e., 64 bit platforms need 64 bit pythons by default)
# You can specify which python to use by setting the environment variable PYO3_PYTHON to point to that python
# For example
#   env PYO3_PYTHON=C:/usr/bin/python32-3.8 cargo build --target i686-pc-windows-msvc --release
